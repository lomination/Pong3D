# Pong3D

A 3D augmented reality pong game where your phone is your paddle!

## Installation

### Android

Please install the application from the built apk located in the [latest release](https://github.com/lomination/Pong3D/releases/latest)'s artifacts.

Once downloaded, open it to install the application. You may need to install [Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_US), in the latter case, a promt will ask you to do so.

Finally, you can open the application and play!

### iOS

The game does not support iOS because an Apple developper license is required to produce applications for iOS.

## Tutorial

Please go to a place where you have several meters free space on both sides. Stand up and hold your phone in front of your chest before launching the game.

Once launched, you can see the playing area, delimited by the blue barriers on the sides.

Simply press the start button to start a round.

Your goal is to prevent the ball from touching the rear red barrier (otherwise the game is lost) by bouncing the ball with your mobile. You earn one point each time the ball bounces on the white front wall. But be careful, the higher your score, the faster the ball moves!
